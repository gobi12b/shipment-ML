I have used Naive bayes classification algorithm.(other alogorithms like SVM can be used)

- Used just description column for classification, if adding other dimensions such as origin country, destionation country makes sense along with descriptions to classify, we can ue that too.

- Data is very less now, so may produce in-accurate prediction


How to run ?

Import the csv and python notebook file Jupiter notebook
